# Parking-System-Project-Using-C
The Parking System project is designed to manage the parking of vehicles in a parking lot. It keeps track of available spaces, records the entry and exit of vehicles, and calculates parking fees based on the duration of stay. This project can be implemented as a console application using the C programming language.
