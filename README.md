# Parking-System-Project-Using-C

The main aim of this project is to reduce the traffic in the parking place. Normally we 
can see in the multiplexes, cinema halls, large industries, and function halls there is 
problem they have to go and search which line is empty and which line having place to 
park the vehicle, for parking then they need workers for parking in correct position it is 
the money consumed process. So to avoid this problem Car Parking System project is 
implemented.
